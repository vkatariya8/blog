Disclaimer : reviewing such a behemoth of a book takes courage, and I don’t think I’ve done justice to it (the book).

Steinbeck’s most controversial book, _The Grapes of Wrath_ details the wanderings and ramblings of the Joad family in an era of agricultural industrialisation in the USA. A family of eleven is forced off their land in Oklahoma due to poor returns, infertility and bank foreclosures. The story starts off with Tom Joad returning home to Sallisaw, Oklahoma after being paroled from McAlester prison. The Joad family consists of Tom, his siblings Noah, Al, Ruthie, Rose of Sharon and Winfield, his parents and his uncle John, his grandparents, and Rose of Sharon’s husband Connie.

The family is forced off their land and is forced to move to California. California, where there are jobs on offer, where there are oranges, cotton and peaches a-ripe for plucking. California, a prophetic land of plenty, a solution to the troubles of three hundred thousand migrants. In reality, California is a harsh land, with the original inhabitants scared of the migrants, scared of hunger, and unwilling to share. Farms are industrialized, large, and the wages are fixed by farming associations. Due to the large influx of migrants, wages are low, and the ‘Okies’ are forced to work for a pittance.

The two central members of the Joad family are Tom and his mother, who is referred to as Ma or Mrs.Joad. Ma is the true backbone of the family. She decided the moods of the family, the family’s response to some event or the other. She was the one who instilled confidence and determination in the rest of the Joads. She is indefatigable, and works relentlessly for the upkeep and benefit of the family. She believes that along the travels and hardships, the only memory the family has of home is the fact that they are together. Even without means to subsist, the family must remain united, and they will see better times. Her primary motive is to always keep everyone together, and keep their spirits up.

> "Ain't you thinkin' what's it gonna be like when we get there? Ain't you scared it won't be nice like we thought?" 

> “No," she said quickly. "No, I ain't. You can't do that. I can't do that. It's too much- livin' too many lives. 

> Her face tightened. "That's all I can do. I can't do no more. All the rest'd get upset if I done any more'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that."

Tom Joad is Ma’s favourite son, and is the one who has a level head, and isn’t fickle minded. Noah has hardly any affection for the family, Al is crazy about women, and Winfield is still young. Tom is hot-blooded. He repeatedly says to keep him away from the unfair policemen and sheriffs, because he feels that he will lose control and become violent towards them. However, his years at prison have not made him crazy or desirous of solitude in an excessive way. 

The Joads leave home on an old Hudson Super Six with only $150 in hand. Grandpa dies one night of a stroke, not far out from home. Granma loses her will to live thus, and dies soon. Noah and Connie also separate from the family, and Ma seems to be losing her grip over the family. Her dream of a united family is crumbling. Later, when Tom gets into trouble again by killing a deputy, he volunteers to leave the family, which is the sensible thing to do, but Ma doesn’t want him far away. Tom ends up hiding in a culvert close to the family’s shelter in a boxcar carriage. 

There are thousands of families, thousands of old, rickety cars on their respective ways to California. Having no money, they camp in ditches on the sides of the highways. The families are initially sad, hopeless and demoralised. However, when they come together and when the men talk to each other, the frustration, sadness and hunger become a smouldering anger. 

> In the evening a strange thing happened: the twenty families became one family, the children were the children of all. The loss of home became one loss, and the golden time in the West was one dream. And it might be that a sick child threw despair into the hearts of twenty families, of a hundred people; that a birth there in a tent kept a hundred people quiet and awestruck through the night and filled a hundred people with the birth-joy in the morning. A family which the night before had been lost and fearful might search its goods to find a present for a new baby. In the evening, sitting about the fires, the twenty were one. They grew to be units of the camps, units of the evenings and the nights. A guitar unwrapped from a blanket and tuned- and the songs, which were all of the people, were sung in the nights. Men sang the words, and women hummed the tunes.

What Steinbeck brings to light in these communions of destitute families is that they still stick together. When together, hope is never completely obliterated. They still help each other. If someone was injured, or if there was a death in one of the tents, a pile of coins would find its way there. Ma once says this.

> "I'm learning one thing good," she said. "Learnin' it all the time, ever' day. If you're in trouble or hurt or need – go to poor people. They're the only ones that'll help – the only ones." 

An interesting facet of the book is the existence of chapters written from a third person’s view, called interchapters. These chapters are interspersed with the story of the Joads, and serve as a general marker of the times. They act as a platform for the author’s views, and they also give a measure of perspective for the backdrop of the entire story. It can also be said that they enhance the American-ness of the entire story. They ground the story much better in the harsh reality of the times.

Steinbeck is critical and scathing in his loathing of banks and associations which work merely for maintaining a profit. He brings to light heinous atrocities brought about by landowners. Five thousand workers would show up when only a thousand jobs were required, thus they were all paid wages far below what was fair. Lands were made to lie fallow, because firms want to maintain their profit. Pa Joad, upon seeing this land, is made immensely sad, and men are made even sadder when seeing the empty land on one side, and their hungry, thinning children on the other.

> There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. **And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.** […] watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the _**grapes of wrath**_ are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.

> A twitch at the controls could swerve the cat', but the driver's hands could not twitch because the monster that built the tractors, the monster that sent the tractor out, had somehow got into the driver's hands, into his brain and muscle, had goggled him and muzzled him- goggled his mind, muzzled his speech, goggled his perception, muzzled his protest. **He could not see the land as it was, he could not smell the land as it smelled; his feet did not stamp the clods or feel the warmth and power of the earth. He sat in an iron seat and stepped on iron pedals. He could not cheer or beat or curse or encourage the extension of his power, and because of this he could not cheer or whip or curse or encourage himself.** He did not know or own or trust or beseech the land.

The passages above are from the interchapters. The interchapters make you realise the scale of the world, and that the Joads are but a drop in the ocean, one of countless families facing hardship. They also reinforce the fact that the book is not a dramatised account of the adventures (in want of a better word) of a family, but rather just an example picked at random.

Steinbeck’s treatment of the Joad family is excellent. The characters and relations that they have with each other are detailed and dynamic, and yet not predictable. He evokes great poignancy, and has created a family that is very believable in its strength, its failings, its hardships and its victories. It is not a perfect family, and at times you find yourself hating some of its actions. 

Descriptions are wonderful. There is a certain economy of words that exists in the writing, but the result is remarkable nonetheless.

> The concrete highway was edged with a mat of tangled, broken, dry grass, and the grass heads were heavy with oat beards to catch on a dog's coat, and foxtails to tangle in a horse's fetlocks, and clover burrs to fasten in sheep's wool; sleeping life waiting to be spread and dispersed, every seed armed with an appliance of dispersal, twisting darts and parachutes for the wind, little spears and balls of tiny thorns, and all waiting for animals and for the wind, for a man's trouser cuff or the hem of a woman's skirt, all passive but armed with appliances of activity, still, but each possessed of the anlage of movement.

The strength and fortitude of Man as a whole is also endeavoured to be brought out. People are pushed around, put to a great deal of trouble but are still not without hope. The Joad family suffers great hardship, but there is still something to live for, something to look forward to. If the work is good this year, they may get a house next year. Rose of Sharon’s pregnancy is something to protect. Children’s innocence, the small peals of laughter at the end of the day. Do what you may ye capitalists, you cannot break Man’s heart. This is what it seems like the novel says.

The book is fraught with sadness, with hardship, but it still seems like there is a spark of optimism still living. The book’s end makes you want to cry, but you will be confused as to whether you are sad or not. It is a bit like _For Whom the Bell Tolls_, because you revel in the peace of the abrupt ending, but you can’t believe how incredibly sad the situation is.

The book is a masterpiece. The ending I won’t spoil for you, but it sure is glorious. Steinbeck has taken a family, a family in abject poverty, a family in shambles, without work, without a home, and has constructed an epic. An epic worthy of a Pulitzer Prize. 

> The women watched the men, watched to see whether the break had come at last. The women stood silently and watched. And where a number of men gathered together, the fear went from their faces, and anger took its place. And the women sighed with relief, for they knew it was all right- the break had not come; and the break would never come as long as fear could turn to wrath.
