Recommended to me as one of the best hard SF books in recent times, _The Three-Body Problem_ did not disappoint. A combination of an ambitious plot and an excellent base in physics make it a must-read for a sci-fi geek like me. I found the ideas in the book compelling, and cannot wait for the next books to come out (which is soon, yay!)

The book is a translation of the original Chinese book. The characters all have Chinese names, and the protagonists of the story are all physicists who have discovered signs of intelligent life in the Earth’s neighbouring Alpha Centauri star system. The book focuses on the interaction of the species of the two worlds, the world of Trisolaris (the three-body problem in question) and Earth.

The story starts off in the time of the Chinese cultural revolution, where the Chinese execute many of their academicians for expounding support to theories such as relativity and quantum mechanics. The description of these scenes shows the author’s contempt and sadness at the stupidity of people back then. A theory of quantum mechanics cannot possibly have political implications, can it? Supposedly, it can. 

But I digress. Scientists are seen committing suicide lately, are not able to give their full attention to their respective topics of research, and no one knows why. A research group called the _Frontiers of Science_ aims to find out if there is a theoretical limit to the amount of knowledge mankind can obtain about the universe. Particle accelerators are malfunctioning, for no obvious reason. 

It is later discovered that this is the doing of an extraterrestrial species, the people of Trisolaris, the planet with three suns. They wish to conquer Earth for themselves and are thus limiting scientific progress in fundamental subjects. Through extremely advanced technology, they are instrumental in implanting delusion in leading scientists around the world that there are no laws of physics that govern the universe.

I’ll stop here to discuss something very interesting I found in the book. The conclusion drawn by people on Earth is that the research on fundamental sciences alone is being hindered. Fundamental research is the branch of science upon which any new breakthrough can be made. If there is no advance in fundamental science, then human technology itself will stagnate soon. I find this to be a very mature point of view.

The namesake of the book, _The Three-Body Problem_ is a computer game that explains the harsh living conditions on Trisolaris. Created by the Earth-Trisolaris Organisation, it helps to increase sympathy for the organisation and raise awareness about human tyranny, that can only be solved by invoking the powers of a more powerful species. The game is the highlight of the book, a near _tour-de force_. It involves one logging in and by living a life in the queer world of Trisolaris (people can dehydrate and rehydrate at will, and there are seemingly random Stable and Chaotic eras), attempting to make sense of its climatic conditions.

This raises philosophical questions. If one knows that the human species is going to do more bad than good, then shouldn’t one try to make an effort to improve the existing conditions? Shouldn’t one stop complaining, bickering and start uniting people under a common front? It seems hypocritical that many of the world’s luminaries and visionaries are willing to take an easy way out by waiting for alien colonisation.

The physical concepts that have been invoked are very well-researched. A mathematical prodigy conjures an algorithm to solve for possible steady states of the three-body problem. A proton is unfolded into two dimensions, is etched with circuits, and is folded back into original eleven-d space to enable effective spying. More details on these at the end, since they’re technical (and spoilers).

The book is a masterpiece, although I found the ending rather rushed and unexplained. The characters are not as deep as I would have liked, but it is tough to do that when writing a science fiction book. The amount of research that has gone into the book is stupendous, and it shines through the entire book. The description of algorithms, radio transmitters, foreign civilisations, all of these are elaborate, complete and consistent. It has been created very fastidiously. Another aspect that was unique was that the book was based in China, but could easily have been based in any other country that has the required number of scientists.  

###### Physics Concepts

**Disclaimer** : These have spoilers. Don’t read if you plan to read the book.

An evolutionary algorithm for solving the three-body problem is described. It goes like this: start the system from some initial conditions, and then take snapshots at closely spaced intervals. Allow the system to evolve in all possible ways, and then filter out those that are detrimental to the system. It has not been described what detrimental exactly means. Now, paths which contain the least number of steps that are detrimental to the system are the ones that a system will take. 

A proton is an extremely small particle, but it exists in 11 dimensions. Advanced civilisations are able to apply operations at micro-dimensions that humans are not able to yet. A proton is thus unfolded into two dimensions, creating what is called a _sophon_. Circuits are then etched onto the sophon, and entangled copies of these are created to serve as an instant path of communication, bypassing the distance divide of four light-years.
