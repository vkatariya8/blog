Yes, I do. I am firmly entrenched in this view. Why?

Federer has the most economy of movement among all players in the modern game. Is this a big deal? Maybe not. When asked what one thing he would take away from Federer to hamper his game the most, Andre Agassi said that he would take away Federer's movement. In short, Federer has the most streamlined movement around the court. He's lithe. His court coverage is cat-like.

What does this economy of movement imply? It means that he can create impossible angles. It means that he can hit stunning attacking shots on the run. It means that he can hit the most outrageous inside-out forehand winners in the men's game (excepting Rafa Nadal, of course). It means that he can finish off a point whenever he wants, he can pull the trigger from any position, because it takes him the least time among all tennis players to get into the right position.

What's more, Federer started off as an aggressive baseliner. He remains an aggressive baseliner. He didn't tweak his game, his style just to counter the styles of others. So what if Nadal hit it high to his single-handed backhand? He made it better. So what if people exposed him on the wide forehand? He stuck, and made his game much much better. Right now, his backhand is not a liability, it is one of the most improved shots in the game, and he gets more spin on his backhand slice than Nadal gets on his forehand. Read that again. No mistake. Wow.

To me, Federer is a cornerstone of aggressive tennis. He stuck by his game even when there were increasingly effective defensive players around, when the courts grew slower, and when he had to work harder and harder for every point he won. He was always faced with the dogma of changing his style to match his opponents, but never considered it. He still is the one tennis player whose shots elicit in me constant sharp intakes of breath. Nearly periodic. Say, every thirty seconds. His shots are so free flowing.

Federer's defence is his most underrated facet. Just because he is the most dominant attacking player in the modern game doesn't mean that he has a mediocre defence. Much of this has been developed in the last few years, with his increasingly effective backhand slice. Didn't I mention coverage on the wide forehand? He's improved that a lot too! Federer can lob, pass and stay in the point with just about anybody, even when he isn't calling the shots.

The best description of Federer's forehand is that is a 'liquid whip'. It truly is. But Federer's forehand is one of the great shots that tennis will see. John McEnroe said that Federer's forehand is the 'greatest shot in our sport' [sic]. More than the raw power that he gets on the forehand, what's underestimated is the variety Federer has on his forehand. He can hit shots with wicked amounts of topspin, he can flatten them out to hit huge winners, he can handle low balls and hit great approaches, he can give you a fake and hit a forehand slice, he can hit an amazing drop shot. Wow. And all of this with the slightest change in technique and grip.

Federer is so damn _consistent_. Hasn't missed a Grand Slam in ages. Hasn't been off tour for an extended period of time. Hardly ever pulls out of a tournament. Doesn't retire from a match. Why? Because of his economy of movement, and his near perfect technique. Nadal says about Federer that his body is built for tennis, that tennis is in Federer's DNA. It's that, but it's also that Federer plays such a technically sound game, and plays with such fluidity that he hardly ever puts excess pressure on any one part of his body.

Roger Federer also has one thing that I don't think any other tennis player has, and that is his God Mode. When this is turned on, Federer can do anything. Literally anything. He can turn defence into attack. He can hit the cutest forehands. He can take outrageous risks and not miss the lines. What can one do in the face of such relentless, pure ballstriking?

Off the court, Federer is a great ambassador for the sport. He is always courteous (yes, he is arrogant, but that doesn't matter). He has a foundation that sponsors schools in South Africa, and he has this story to his credit.

[Mashable story about Beatriz]

Oh, and by the way, he has 17 Grand Slam titles, a feat that will probably never be emulated in the future.
