by Vernor Vinge

Finding its way into the top ten of many science fiction lists, *A Fire Upon the Deep* is a thoroughly engrossing novel, both in terms of plot and scientific believability. The hallmark of a good science fiction novel, according to me, is the introduction of some new hypothetical concept based on the scientific progress at the time of publishing.

 In the book I last reviewed, *The Three Body Problem*, Cixin Liu talks about protons monitoring the Earth, a planet subject to a three-body problem (in the real sense) and an evolutionary algorithm for solving the three body problem. In this book, Vernor Vinge talks about the existence of various Zones in the Milky Way. The zones are characterised by the level of technology, civilisation and availability of sentient software.

The humans’ original planet, Earth, was deep in the Slowness, the Zone where one is limited by the speed of light and where advanced automation and software doesn’t work. Civilisations in the Slowness are doomed to their primitiveness unless they make their way somehow to the Beyond, where they may attain greater levels of technology. Beyond the Beyond (yes, you saw what I did there) is the Transcend, where the Powers reside. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, the resident civilisations are so advanced that the sentient artificial intelligences they create slowly overpower the civilisation itself. Civilisations don’t last longer than ten years in the Transcend, on an average. However, every race wishes to transcend; why, I do not understand.

> The Zones are a natural protection; without them, human-equivalent intelligence would probably not exist.” She waved at the misty star swarms. “The Beyond and below are like a deep of ocean, and we the creatures that swim in the abyss. We’re so far down that the beings on the surface — superior though they are — can’t effectively reach us. Oh, they fish, and they sometimes blight the upper levels with poisons we don’t even understand. But the abyss remains a relatively safe place.” She paused. There was more to the analogy. “And just as with an ocean, there is a constant drift of flotsam from the top. There are things that can only be made at the Top, that need close-to-sentient factories — but which can still work down here. Blueshell mentioned some of those when he was talking to you: the agrav fabrics, the sapient devices. Such things are the greatest physical wealth of the Beyond, since we can’t make them. And getting them is a deadly risky endeavor.”

The story is about a perverted AI system that is unleashed by a certain set of humans from the Straumli Realm. This AI is a Power, that is, a Transcended creature. It is known in the book as the Blight (reminds me of Wheel of Time, and an apt comparison at that). The Blight operates to conquer the Beyond, and destroys many a civilisation, killing billions in the process.

There are some interesting things that come to light in this book.

**Humans in the galaxy**

Human beings aren’t the star race of the galaxy. They are one of the many races that graduated into the Beyond from the Slowness, of which there is no dearth. Humans from the Straumli Realm were the ones responsible for the release of the perverted AI system, and are thus hunted down by other races. Humans seem to be a fairly successful trader race, and not much else.

**Pack thinking**

A lot of the story focuses on activities that happen on the Tines’ World, the inhabitants of which are pack animals in a way that you can never imagine. Each being is a pack, consisting of four to six members on an average. Each member of a pack is able to move independently, thus rendering each pack with a complete gamut of sensory skill. It is slightly disconcerting, to start off, to discover that each individual is referred to as a *pack*. How do these individual members of a pack coordinate? They are able of fast communication by some telepathic method. This has a profound consequence, that each of these individuals cannot be in proximity of each other to prevent the interference of each’s *mind noise*, so to speak.

**Tines vs Humans**

The Tines, as they are called in the book, marvel at humans’ vulnerability (one human has only one member which when killed results in the death of the entire human) and also at humans’ incredible ability to be close to each other without interfering with each others mind noise.

> Yet the more Steel saw, the more he realized the intrinsic inferiority of the aliens: What a bizarre abortion they were, a race of intelligent singletons. Every one of them must be raised from nothing, like a wholly newborn pack. Memories could only be passed by voice and writing. Each creature grew and aged and even died as a whole. Despite himself, Steel shivered.

**Tines as a Race**

The Tines live in a world in the Slowness, and the action taking place on their planet is an instructive sociological study of a medieval world. I find that Vinge has done an admirable job while describing the Tines. The Tines are weak and hampered in a way we cannot imagine, but are also capable of great longevity and feats of coordination. They are intelligent, diverse, but the most interesting facet is the effect of each member on the nature of the pack. Blood kenning is an art practised by Woodcarver and the Flenser which involves cultivation of different traits in members to imbibe certain desirable quantities in a pack.

> This was a obviously a great emergency. A person might be dying. People were rushing this way and that. And yet…. The packs drew into themselves. No one crowded close. No one could touch another.

**The Blight**

> The new Power’s mood drifted, calmed. A human might call the feeling triumph, anticipation. Simple hunger might be more accurate. What more is needed when there are no enemies?

The Blight is supremely intelligent, and bending all that intelligence to overpower civilisations in the galaxy. What is terrifying is the reliance of all these worlds on technology, so much so that a mere software abstraction is able to make drastic, life-threatening changes. Is this some sort of warning from Vinge to us? Is he speculating on the large-scale proliferation of technology in the universe? This scarily echoes Elon Musk’s haunts about the dangers of AI systems.

 So much for the technological aspects of the novel. Vinge’s treatment of characters is good, even if some of it is one-dimensional. Is this something all science fiction authors suffer from? A trade-off between character and plot? A topic for another day, surely. 

Raven and Pham are described deeply.

> Somewhere inside, he knew the truth too, and she suddenly wanted to hug him, comfort him. It was like having a terribly wounded friend, with whom you can talk but never mutually admit the scope of the injuries. Instead she pretended the lapses didn’t exist, smiling and laughing at the rest of his story.

 The treatment of the two surviving children from Straumli Realm, Jefri and Johanna, was far from ideal, with them serving more as strategic pawns in the chessboard of plot. But but. Vinge talks about Tines. He talks about Skoderiders. He talks about Powers, AI beings, and he’s believable most of the time. That’s a great achievement. If the purpose of the novel was to give a sobering simulation of humans’ relative position in cosmological hierarchy, then Vinge can take an emphatic bow.

I’ve decided not to talk about the actual plot of the story because I believe that I’ve made a compulsive case for any science fiction junkie to pick this book up. Even if you don’t like sci-fi, I think this is a great place to start. *A Fire Upon the Deep* is a good entrenched-in-science book, but doesn’t lose out on characterisation and plot. 

Godshatter.
