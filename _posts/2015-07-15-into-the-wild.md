_According to the moral absolutism that characterizes McCandless’s beliefs, a challenge in which a successful outcome is assured isn’t a challenge at all._

Chronicling the adventures of Chris McCandless, _Into the Wild_ is a slightly depressing book. It is filled with themes of loneliness, rebellion  and a deep-seated dislike of modern life where one must interact with a manifold of people every day. _Into the Wild_ is about Chris McCandless, a young, sharp and smart man who wishes to get away from society and live __in the wild__, alone, fending for himself.

Chris’ parents are autocratic, who have great expectations of their children, and thus Chris is forced to embark on a journey to Harvard Medical School, failing which, as a ‘poor consolation’, he must become a lawyer. The constant drive to be successful, to do things as his parents deem fit, and the relentless pressure inject a wedge between Chris and his parents. He calls them idiots and says that once he leaves, he wouldn’t speak to them again in his life.

Chris was distant from his family, but he was very close to his sister Carine, who he acknowledged was the only person in the world who truly understood her. By this, he meant that she was the only person who understood Chris’ natural yearning to be out, to be living a challenging life, where he was always fending off the country, never knowing that his future was secure. Chris read a lot of Tolstoy, Thoreau, and Jack London, convincing himself that a life out of the mainstream (_enemic_) American society was the way forward to attain true happiness.

Chris has a very critical outlook of modern life, saying that __careers were demeaning twentieth-century inventions__, more of a liability than an asset, and that he would do fine without one. This is what he says to a certain eighty-year old Ronald Franz, who lives out happily on his veteran pension :

> You are wrong if you think Joy emanates only or principally from human relationships. God has placed it all around us. It is in everything and anything we might experience. We just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle and engage in unconventional living.

> So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality __nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future__. The very basic core of a man’s living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, Ron, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty.

Chris was well set in college to have a good career, and he had $40,000 in his college fund to go about his education. He stayed in school for some time, and didn’t see the value in it (any Steve Jobs reference?). He donated the $25,000 he had left to OXFAM, never told his parents about it, and went for an adventure in his beloved Datsun car into the Mojave desert. People who gave him rides were enamoured by his culture and his intellect, always asking him to stay over at their places, extracting promises from his to call his parents, and asking him to write back to them.

Among his friends were Wayne Westerberg, Jack Gallien and Jan Burres. He would send them postcards and write to them often, always saying that they were grand people, that he was very grateful for their love and hospitality, and saying that he would try to see them again. I think Chris considered such friends as his true family. He had burned all the bridges with his own family long ago. Maybe his parents didn’t understand him? Can they truly be blamed for expecting excellence of only the highest order from their children, when they knew that they were capable of it? I think that they could’ve been more lenient, as could most parents in the world today.

After his adventure in the Mojave, where he loses his car (but is never in mortal danger), he has another adventure where he crosses into Mexico and painstakingly crosses back into America via the Gulf of Mexico. He __hadn’t seen another soul in thirty-six days__. Upon culmination, he decides to go to LA and get himself an ID and a job, to get back to the bores to everyday life. In his diary, he writes :

> feels extremely uncomfortable in society now and must return to road immediately

Whenever on his travels, Chris would adopt the moniker Alex McCandless or Alex Supertramp so as to not belie his location to his parents. This indicates how irritated he was with the mediocre everyday city life, and how infuriated he was with his parents. This goes to show how seriously he viewed his own philosophy of life, in which living life takes foremost priority.

> At long last he was unencumbered, emancipated from the stifling world of his parents and peers, a world of abstraction and security and material excess, a world in which he felt grievously cut off from the raw throb of existence.

When I read this sentence, I highlighted __the raw throb of existence__. It struck a chord within me, that this young man felt stifled by the mediocre life he led, and always sought to escape from the hustle and bustle. Do we really feel the thrumming of life in our day-to-day city lives? I think not. Does this vindicate Chris' attitude, his anger? Is anger even the right word?

Chris, or rather Alex, decided to take a final, epic odyssey into the wilds of Alaska. He tells everybody about it, is gung-ho and can’t wait to get there. He plans to get to Fairbanks around May 1992 and then spend the whole Alaskan summer on his own, fending for himself, living off the lay of the land. It was to be one final purge of the dirt of city life. Alex tells everybody, and even himself, that he plans to quit his tramping and wandering after this trip.

The trip to Alaska started off very well, with Alex/Chris finding game in plenty, and also settling down in an old abandoned bus (Fairbanks #142). He finds the landscape and life well to his liking, and his diary is populated mainly with the game he catches each day. When he decides to get back to society, he realises that he cannot cross the river back to Fairbanks (it is in full flow, with the summer thaw) and decides to live out the summer in Alaska. Unfortunately, he is poisoned by mould that grows on the seeds of the wild potato that he eats and stands little chance against the oncoming weakness. He suffers for some 20 days, and passes away. Ironically, it is his philosophy that causes his downfall. He says that he wishes to be someplace off the map, and to accomplish that, he carries no map at all. If he had, he would’ve known that there was an easy crossing of the river only 5 miles away, and that there were two other camps in the vicinity of his.

I’d like to quote this :

> Like not a few of those seduced by the wild, McCandless seems to have been driven by a variety of lust that supplanted sexual desire. His yearning, in a sense, was too powerful to be quenched by human contact. McCandless may have been tempted by the succor offered by women, but it paled beside the prospect of rough congress with nature, with the cosmos itself. And thus was he drawn north, to Alaska.

What I admire in Chris is his decisiveness. Whenever he undertook a certain task, he made sure to complete it. He, unlike most people living today, lived out his life always abiding by his beliefs. He was never shy about it, and told people without shame what he thought of life, what he thought of his parents, and how he relished living in the wild, on the road. Chris had a different idea of joy and happiness than the rest of the world. He says that it is in the experiences and the great triumphant joy of living to the fullest extent in which real meaning is found.

His antisociality isn't really a sense of introversion. He enjoyed himself well when in the company of others, but sometimes he would stay by himself. A friend once said about him that he saved up the company for the times when he was with himself. That's an interesting way of thinking about it. When he went to Alaska, he was relieved that he had 'evaded the impending threat of human intimacy, of friendship and all the messy emotional baggage that comes with it'.

The death of Chris McCandless is a true tragedy. It is not due to his incompetence in the wild, but rather something that was bound to come to him by living out so much of his life alone, fending for himself. Who is truly to blame? His parents? Surely that’s a bit too harsh. Society? I personally feel that it is biased to exclude Chris from this all. He did not consider how it would hurt others if he died. Just because he had cut off ties with his parents does not mean that they didn’t care for him anymore. Chris’ death was an accident, but may not have happened if he had a more sincere and understanding family.

Overall, the book is a detailed read. It gets a bit draggy at times, but the descriptions are vivid. The last few books I’ve read have all had superb descriptive writing, so my benchmarks are already high. I find it admirable that Krakauer gleans so much about Chris, his adventure and his life from the available notes and materials. Krakauer's depth is nearly obsessional. The account is unbiased, and the facts are placed straight. It is an admirable work of non-fiction.

To conclude, this, said by one of Chris’ friends in high school :

> The whole idea was to lose our bearings, to push ourselves into unknown territory. Then we’d run at a slightly slower pace until we found a road we recognized and race home again at full speed. In a certain sense that’s how Chris lived his entire life.
