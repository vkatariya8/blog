_The Dharma Bums_ is a very nice, refreshing read. Written by the great stalwart of the Beat generation, Jack Keruoac, it is infused with the signature lifestyle of the hipster generation. This book captures the spiritual nature of the counterculture through a catalogue of the life of the protagonist Ray Smith, and his best friend and counsellor Japhy Ryder.

What I find peculiar about the whole book is the intimacy with which the characters speak of Buddhism. I find it slightly disturbing, or even annoying, that they call each other Bodhisattvas, and reincarnations of Buddhist saints of the past. I also find it disturbing that Ray, while following some of the tenets of Buddhism, and indulging in meditation, still is a heavy drinker. It’s not that I am judging him, but that I thought religion was to be put on a pedestal and kept pure.

However, that isn’t the case. Here, Buddhism isn’t portrayed exactly as the Buddhism of the East or the Orient, it is portrayed as a spiritual exercise and way of life. It is not treated as a religion. Thus, Keruoac paints a vivid, albeit skewed, picture of the Buddhist philosophies, and is also justified in doing so.

The nature trails and treks described in the book are truly surreal. The best is this passage :

> We finally got out of there and climbed on up, soon leaving the shrubbery and entering a new alpine height of rocky meadow with blue lupine and red poppy feathering the gray mist with lovely vaguenesses of color and the wind blowing hard now and with sleet.

I love the usage of ‘vaguenesses of color’. It makes the image seem so vivid, with the all-encompassing fog in the background, and the tinges of color cast by the lupine and poppy being diffused in the fog.

One of the central Buddhist philosophies in the book is that the world is empty, so is everyone, and everyone is one with the world.

> You'll be sorry some day. Why don't you ever understand what I'm trying to tell you: it's with your six senses that you're fooled into believing not only that you have six senses, but that you contact an actual outside world with them. If it  wasn't for your eyes, you wouldn't see me. If it wasn't for  your ears, you wouldn't hear that airplane. If it wasn't for  your nose, you wouldn't smell the midnight mint. If it wasn't  for your tongue taster, you wouldn't taste the difference between A and B. If it wasn't for your body, you wouldn't feel Princess. There is no me, no airplane, no mind, no Princess, no nothing, you for krissakes do you want to go on being fooled every damn minute of your life?"

This again, is a superb description. Everything that you see, feel, hear, taste et cetera, is because you _want_ to feel, you want to perceive the outside world. Each object in the world is merely an abstraction, and it takes on a particular shape only because you are viewing it. This recalls what I know of quantum mechanics, that a particle exhibits some activity, but showcases a certain (and usually different state) when it is being observed.

> One afternoon I was sitting with some children in the grass and they asked me "Why is the sky blue?" "Because the sky is blue." "I wanta know why the sky is blue." "The sky is blue because you wanta know why the sky is blue."

> Comparisons are odious.

This is another line that finds a place multiple times in the book. The point being conveyed here is that everything is the same, it doesn’t matter where you are, what you are talking about, or what you are comparing. Since everything in the world is one with the world, nothing can be different from anything.

I think that this point of view is a slightly weak and attackable one. This is what causes the characters in the book to have a slight indifference to the vices they pursue. Japhy, in particular, says that he could stop eating meat, but quotes the above interpretation of the world and says that everything in the world is linked, it doesn’t matter whatever you eat, since all is of the world. In addition, this could be a convenient escape from a moral dilemma.

There are a few eventful passages in the book. The first is when Ray visits his friend Cody whose wife Rose is convinced that she must die, that everyone’s sins have been discovered by the police who will come and punish her. She inflicts scars and cuts on herself, and Ray is unable to convince her to snap out of her state. She commits suicide later that night, and funnily, the matter isn’t given much attention. Ray does wonder if he was responsible for it, but he is more interested in the dilemma of Rose, and wishes to examine. Later he claims that Rose was right, that there is nothing to live for, that you could attain no spiritual growth in our cold lonely world.

> Then suddenly one night after supper as I was pacing in the cold windy darkness of the yard I felt tremendously depressed and threw myself right on the ground and cried "I'm gonna die!" because there was nothing else to do in the cold loneliness of this harsh inhospitable earth, and instantly the tender bliss of enlightenment was like milk in my eyelids and I was warm. And I realized that this was the truth Rosie knew now, and all the dead, my dead father and dead brother and dead uncles and cousins and aunts, the truth that is realizable in a dead man's bones and is beyond the Tree of Buddha as well as the Cross of Jesus. Believe that the world is an ethereal flower, and ye live. I knew this! I also knew that I was the worst bum in the world. The diamond light was in my eyes.

This is a contrasting passage, but it really summaries the whole book. I’ll try to explain what I can. This is when Ray is alone on Mount Desolation as part of his summer job, and his primary occupation during the daytime is to meditate all alone. The ‘enlightenment’ he undergoes isn’t exactly an enlightenment, it is merely him understanding that the current world is not a place to grow spiritually. He says that the ultimate truth of life transcends beyond religion, and that one must believe that the world is but a fleeting collection of senses.

He explains, paradoxically, that one must give up all expectations from the world, from _samsara_, to make the most of one’s life.

From this, I figure Ray’s character to be slightly hypocritical. He does uncover these truths, but he still is described as a hopeless drunkard, and doesn’t seem to follow his ideals closely. His is, to me, an accurate description of the American hipster generation. They found solace in cults of Zen and Buddhism, but were still ultimately confused. They were torn between the life of revelry and fun that they knew and the enlightenment waiting for them across the bridge of spirituality.

Japery crosses the Pacific to learn at a monastery in Japan, and I think that he transcended the barrier of spirituality. He put aside his American culture and immersed himself in the study of Buddhism. This is why I admire Japhy.

To conclude, this :

> Are we fallen angels who didn't want to believe that nothing is nothing and so were born to lose our loved ones and dear friends one by one and finally our own life, to see it proved?

This summaries the book. Its central theme, in terms of the Buddhist philosophies, is that the world is nothing, it is empty, and that we are empty too, and part of the world and one with it. It paints an Americanised portrait of Buddhism, does full justice to the counterculture movement, and has deep characters. However, it isn’t without it’s minor drawbacks. I found the explanations to be at some times inconclusive, and at some times contradictory, but then again, those dead ends leave the topic open to one’s interpretation, and some paraphrasing from the reader’s side piques one’s interest further.

Is it a must-read? Not for everyone, but if you are interested in reading books of the Beat Generation, then _The Dharma Bums_ is a great place to start, if you haven’t read _On The Road_ already. If you are interested in a slightly obtuse view of Buddhism, with lots of quirks but still filled with small gems, this book is also for you.
