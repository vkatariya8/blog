John McEnroe said that Federer’s forehand is the greatest shot in the sport of tennis. There’s nothing as breathtaking to watch as Federer waltzing around the ball on his backhand side and hitting one of his ethereal inside-out forehands. So much grace, like a swan. So much power, from a just-perfect technique. Even after making it all look so fluidic and graceful, he paints the lines.

So much for waxing eloquent about Federer’s forehand. I was watching some highlights of his matches in 2005, and one thing I noticed was that Federer was hitting the ball seriously hard. There was no holding back. I watched the first set of then 2005 US Open final, and Agassi was getting hammered whenever he placed the ball even slightly short. 

Federer’s technique then was different. He hasn’t changed his grip, which is a conservative semi-western one, but his body, hip and torso rotation have undergone quite some change. Federer then was willing to stand in a much more open stance, and thus was able to swing much cleaner through the ball. The open stance enabled him to generate wicked angles on his forehands, enabling him to aim for the corners at will, given a short ball. He used his legs a lot more than it seems. What I mean to say is that he got really high above the ground when he made contact. Each forehand was a full-blown swing. What’s wrong with this? Surely hitting it hard and being able to hammer winners from any position is worth it.

One, such a shot needs a lot of preparation time. It would happen often with hard hitting opponents that Federer didn’t really have much juice on his forehand replies. Considering that Federer’s backhand was really passive compared to his forehand back then (and even now, to an extent), it became a serious liability. This game was very well suited to positions in which he was making the first strike, but it seriously hampered his ability to play good defense.

Federer’s forehand was slightly predictable back then. You could see that he had three goto shots. One was the crosscourt slap, the other was the nothing-shot down the middle and the third was the whip down the line. He had great speed, and was able to seriously flatten down some of his shots, but they were a bit one-dimensional. His forehand now is a much more versatile weapon. He may not have the raw speed he had then on all his shots, but he picks his moments well.

One of the major facets of Federer’s modern play has been his coverage of the wide forehand. I think that is a massive improvement. He has security to run around his backhand to hit those massive inside out forehands. 

For all of Federer’s power, he didn’t paint the lines as much on his forehand wing as he does now. I assume that is because of his open stance, and his much more free swing than now. But boy, he compensated for that by hitting it _hard_.

Federer’s forehand is versatile. Right now, more than anything, it’s such an all-court weapon. Back in 2005, I noticed that Federer wasn’t really able to change direction as easily as he is now. I’m not sure what the cause of this is, but it probably is a result of him striking across the ball, and not as much through it. I’m not saying that he didn’t strike through the ball (I haven’t seen anyone do it better), I’m saying that it was comparatively lacking in the past.

Federer took the ball _early_. So early. He made sure that he was always the one playing the role of aggressor. Taking the ball that early enabled him to dominate rallies, and finish off points by pulling the trigger at his chosen moments. Short ball? Wham. Bam. Federer played all those points on his own terms. Am I saying that it doesn’t happen now? I’m not really sure. I think Federer has become a lot more _adaptive_, so to speak, which is definitely a good thing. More than anything, it has been a result of the advent of the Djokovics and the Nadals who push him to play his very best. His first strike game is still the best, but it’s a more honed version of what it was then, consisting of more than just pure power.

Which is the better strategy? The better forehand? The one in 2005 was raw, with the passion of youth, the frenzy of power. The one now is vicious, with verve and guile. His forehand has always possessed an eerie, languid grace. Whichever it is, one cannot simply go toe to toe with Federer when his forehand wing is in flow.
