*Five Weeks in the Amazon* is a nice, short read. It’s engaging, written in an easy-to-read manner, and deals with issues that all of us deal with in our lives. If you’re looking for great prose and literature, prepare to be disappointed. However, if you’re looking for a heartfelt account of one person’s recovery from a low point in life, you will not be disappointed.

The book is about a purgatory trip of Sean Hayes, a professional skateboarding coach, to the Amazon in Peru.  An accomplished skateboarder, his career plummeted in his 20s. He was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder, and later suffered from depression. He made a successful comeback wherein he coached many skateboarders to landslide victories. He then married rashly, and promptly divorced in a year. He’s scared of love, he’s scared of work, and is terribly addicted to alcohol and drugs.

He has seen success, he has seen failure, and he doesn’t treat those two imposters just the same. To cleanse himself of all this (this sounds like the typical modern fairy tale) he goes to the Amazonian rainforest to try out the Ayahuasca treatment.

> During all the successes, and especially during the failures, I kept coming back to the feeling of wanting to die. I didn’t hate my life. I hated how much it hurt to be alive.

Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic drug particularly popular in South America. It is prepared as a slimy green liquid that is to taken in shots during ‘ceremonies’ that are usually a few hours long. It is *very very* bitter and makes you puke (possibly multiple times) during the course of the ceremony. Doesn’t sound too inviting does it? To call it a ceremony is an irony, because the ceremony consists primarily of the ingestion of the Ayahuasca and the subsequent puking. These ceremonies, and the ingestion of Ayahuasca, serve to physiologically and psychologically cleanse and purge your body. A treatment session will consist of roughly ten to twelve ceremonies, spread over a month.

It’s effect?

> This is what makes Ayahuasca special and different from other psychoactive drugs. It doesn’t just bend your conscious perception of reality (like most hallucinogens); it opens a part of our personal reality we don’t often have access to. It gives us the ability to enter and extend the window of time we experience between waking (conscious) and dream (unconscious) states.

Hayes has serious issues with life, and the first one is his issue with truth. Suffering from depression at times, and coping with a divorce, he is forced to ask himself frequently if life is worth living at all. Is his life worth all the pain? Is it worth all the effort? What is the ultimate purpose? He doesn’t ask it from a spiritual perspective, but rather from an ergonomic one.

> More than love, than money, than fame, give me truth.

This is to some extent what we all look for in our individual lives. What we live through gives us stress, pain and trouble. In the end, are we happier or more satisfied than when we started off? 

Does Hayes find *truth* in his Ayahuasca journey? Well, he doesn’t find any transcendental secrets of the universe, but he does learn to look at himself in a more objective manner. He relives the emotions that stymie him, that trap him in the dogma of his past. He must confront his pain, and make himself strong enough to face and accept it. 

In our modern lives, we have been numbed to emotions. Numbed to *feel*. When we love, hate, or even feel happy, our emotions are not pure. We are often confused, and need to remind ourselves of our mood. Why? Because there’s so much emotion that we’re confused? Or because there’s so much negativity to mask, and it’s beneficial to not feel at all.

> I feel free now. I have seen the most painful parts of myself for what they are and I have the strength to face any part of them. Now I know that without any doubts.

Maybe this purge is what we all need. The ability to feel, to witness the crests and troughs in our own emotions. To realise true love and happiness what we need is a peeling off of our thick skins, of our desire of mere material objects.

Moving on, what Hayes talks about in great depth is love. His original definition of love is skewed, explaining why he marries in a month, and divorces within a year. Hayes perceived love as a way of helping his beloved. He thought that serving as a source of honest opinion, or as a source of increased happiness would *help* others. To him, love was a one-way street, more of an economic trade than a fair exchange. 

He later realises that this meant constantly undermining the other party in the relationship. By wanting to help them rise, he forced them, in his mind’s eye, to come from someplace below.

Hayes has had a rollercoaster of a love life. At the time of traveling to Peru, he was seeing a girl named Kelsey. As he examined himself, closer, a love was beginning to blossom in him for her. I find this weird, but maybe it’s because it was a feeling that he refused to set free or to acknowledge. Hayes has been hurt by people he has loved, and perhaps he thinks to not love is to escape this pain.

By reconciling himself to his past, Hayes asks Kelsey to be his girlfriend on a phone call. He receives an emphatic YES! YES! as an answer (:D). In *Wheel of Time*, a wise woman speaks of a man coming of age:

> He has abandoned the strength of the stones, and has adopted now the strength of the wind.

Has Hayes adopted this same strength of the wind? Facing and accepting his shortcomings makes him stronger in a way that he had not thought possible. He, who was afraid of falling in love because it would hurt him, began to look at love (and life) as a pursuit of higher emotion, something that must be expressed to fully live life.

> Back then, I’d loved without hesitation, giving my heart completely. That’s the most valuable thing I lost in that relationship: my undiluted innocence. I’ll be coming to the table as a new me, someone much different from who I’ve been in all my other relationships. If I have a new respect for love, then it stands to reason I will have a new outcome.

Vices are something that pervade Hayes’ life quite freely. At his rock bottom in life (before embarking on this trip), he was addicted to alcohol and to drugs. He’d lost most of his willpower over himself, and was struggling to face the trials and tribulations of life. 

> …which is why vices are helpful. They give me something to hold on to when real life feels slippery.

When one takes Ayahuasca, one must strictly adhere to a special diet which forbids alcohol and other psychedelic drugs. In a period of little weed and no alcohol, Hayes finds that his body is detoxified, and his thinking is clearer. His self esteem is increased, and he can afford to be more free with himself.

Hayes’ book didn’t particularly inspire me, but it made me look at myself, and cross out a mental checklist of my emotions. The book is entertaining and lucid, while touching upon deep and sensitive topics. It also deals with South America in a very nice manner, while also describing experiences with Ayahuasca, which would prove very useful if you needed a purge in the Amazon ;).
