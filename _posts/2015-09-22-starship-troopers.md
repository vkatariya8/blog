Starship troopers is a great book. It is the definitive work in military science fiction. The book isn't what you expect; it doesn't really have a plot. It’s more of a political essay, with Robert Heinlein posing his comments on warfare, modern politics, and universal suffrage, just to name a few topics.

The book is about Juan Rico, a young man from Earth (the Terran Foundation) who decides to sign up for the Army contrary to his father’s wishes. This is not any army, this is an army that fights on planetary scales against foreign species, the species in this case being the ‘Bugs’, spider-like creatures that are clearly demarcated into Workers, Warriors, Brains, and Queens. Is this Heinlein’s idea of what interspecies war will look like? There are heavy casualties on both sides, but the fundamental issue is that neither side _understands_ the other. They’re both encroaching on space the other wants, and without any dialogue between them, there is no alternative but a full-fledged war that leaves one wondering what they are actually fighting for.

### Elite soldiers

Rico is assigned to the elite Mobile Infantry unit of the Terran Army. He, along with every member of the M. I. (as the Mobile Infantry) is called, is extremely proud of his station. Soldiers of the M. I. regularly take ‘drops’, which are nothing but drops onto planets where raids must be undertaken. They wear special powered armour that lets them sustain themselves in foreign atmospheres for upto ten hours, and are capable of moving at speeds of upto forty miles an hour. A certain Marine General said that the M. I. was the ideal that the US Marines should strive for.

In the M. I., everybody fights. 

> If we ever deviate from this, the M. I. will go to pieces. All that holds us together is an idea - one that binds more strongly than steel but its magic power depends on keeping it intact. It is this "everybody fights" rule.

The M. I. never leaves any of its own behind. A rescue of even a single person was _always_ attempted, regardless of the peril. 

Elite or not, a soldier’s life is a soldier’s life. 

> I made a very important discovery at Camp Currie. Happiness consists in getting enough sleep. Just that, nothing more.

### History and Modern Philosophy

In the time the book is set, every school student is subject to _History and Modern Philosophy_. Rico’s teacher is a certain Mr. Dubois, a laconic and rather cynical man. The subject is the only one that has no examinations, it requires only an attestation by the instructor. The class is a hotbed of arguments, with Mr. Dubois grilling students with fundamental and sometimes disturbing questions. One of the most interesting discussions is one where Rico is asked when one party should declare war on another. Is it when they hold a thousand prisoners, a hundred prisoners, or even a single prisoner? When should you, and when are you justified? 

Rico, after his stint in the M. I., decides to sign up for OCS (Officer Candidate School). There, he is again forced to undergo a training in History and Modern Philosophy, this time stricter, with mathematical proofs involving logic and syllogisms to be submitted for every statement made. Why? Maybe a way to ensure the right propaganda in the minds of the officers of the army? Or is it just a way to ensure your officers are clear-headed and sharp?

#### Suffrage, and the right to citizenship

In the world the book is set in, residents of the Terran Foundation are not allowed to hold public offices or be part of the electoral franchise without serving a two year term in the Army. A significant portion of the book discusses this aspect of society, with Heinlein trying to convince his readers that this is a stable long-term solution to corruption, idleness and inefficiency.

> I could hear Colonel Dubois in my mind: "Citizenship is an attitude, a state of mind, an emotional conviction that the whole is greater than the part . . . and that the part should be humbly proud to sacrifice itself that the whole may live.”

One should not be granted the state of citizenship merely by virtue of having been born. One is granted citizenship only when he shows that he is willing to sacrifice for the greater good of the polity. Difficult to digest? Yes, but who knows how the future will turn out? Maybe this will be the system that works out best. 

> “Now here are we with still another system . . . and our system works quite well. Many complain but none rebel; personal freedom for all is greatest in history, laws are few, taxes are low, living standards are as high as productivity permits, crime is at its lowest ebb. Why? Not because our voters are smarter than other people; we've disposed of that argument. 

### Autobiography?

The book surely isn’t an autobiography, but Mr. Dubois and later Mr. Reid (the History and Modern Philosophy instructor at OCS camp) are clearly Heinlein’s mouthpieces. The book as such is a vehicle for the author’s philosophies, and his views on the world. Some say the book inspired by the end of the Korean war, because it was written only five years after its end. It makes direct references to it.

> No Department of Defense ever won a war.

#### Life philosophy, Satire

Heinlein mocks the US Constitution. What does the pursuit of happiness mean?

> Cast me into a dungeon, burn me at the stake, crown me king of kings, I can 'pursue happiness' as long as my brain lives - but neither gods nor saints, wise men nor subtle drugs, can insure that I will catch it."

Do humans have morals? Surely they do. Are they born with them? Or are morals just a set of rules set by society? 

> What is 'moral sense'? It is an elaboration of the instinct to survive. The instinct to survive is human nature itself, and every aspect of our personalities derives from it. 

### Finishing thoughts

This is the first time I’ve categorised a review in this manner, and I think it gives it good structure, and creates an agenda for both me to write and hopefully, for you to read. _Starship Troopers_ is a really good book, because of its vision and detail. It lacks a plot, but makes up for it with some great insights. It’s a book I think everybody should read, because it poses sharp questions that a lot of us do not have answers to. There are some things we take for granted that do not exist in the world the book is set in. The difference between this and say, _Brave New World_, is that every aspect of society is explained clearly. It isn’t the best military science fiction book for nothing, so go read!
