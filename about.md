I am an undergrad student at IIT Madras, about to enter my junior year. I am majoring in Engineering Physics, and have always had a great fascination for reading and books. If not for my passion for engineering, I think I would've majored in literature. I have interest in solving any types of problems, and anything analytic or algorithmic piques my attention.

This blog has been a pet project of mine for a while, but it was always being shelved. It's finally come out, and it's a platform where I write about books that I'm interested in. You can call them reviews, but they're slightly more than that. I believe that what you take away from a book is not the story or the characters, but the ideas, emotions and feelings in the book. That is what I try to bring out in the analyses on this blog.

Hope you enjoy reading!
